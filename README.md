straeto-scraper
===============

A simple Python scraper for s.is

First version, undocumented and very raw. Run the scraper:

    $ ./scraper.py

and your current directory will fill up with route-XX.json files containing
info for routes 1 - 44.

Depends on the [Requests HTTP library](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/).
